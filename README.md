# Optimizing Handwritten Digit Recognition using KNN and Feature Engineering

In this project, we utilized a dataset comprising 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each with a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

The objective was to employ feature engineering techniques to meticulously craft predictive features that could significantly enhance the KNN model's ability to discern the digits in these images.

After refining the features and optimizing the model, we conducted thorough testing. We evaluated the model's performance by comparing accuracy metrics across various feature sets, thus ensuring the most effective predictors were utilized.
